1. Go to the following link: https://console.developers.google.com/, create a OAuth 2.0 client with the email address that you will use to send the leave invites from and download it in JSON format
2. Save the downloaded JSON with the name "credentials.json" under the same directory that you will run the main.py from
3. Create a API Token on Kolay IK (http://destek.kolayik.com/tr/articles/4691230-api-icin-token-nasil-alirim-v2) and insert it into the code. (<API_TOKEN> in main.py should be replaced with the token that you get)
4. Replace the email in the brackets in the code with the email you will use to send the leave invites from. ([EMAIL] should be replaced with the email you will use in the code)
